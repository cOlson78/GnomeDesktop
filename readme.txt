HOW TO RUN:

In your Gnome desktop, make sure you have the "extensions" activity installed. Then, move this extension into the folder .local/share/gnome-shell/extensions. (If you are using the normal file manager, you may need to select to include hidden files for the .local directory to show up.)
                                                                                                                                              
Then, go to the terminal and type in "dbus-run-session -- gnome-shell --nested --wayland".

Then, in the new session, you can go into the "extensions" activity and select "Swiss Army Widget"

The widget should show up in the top right corner by the sound and charge symbols. It should look like a smiley face.
                                                                                                                                                              
You can now play around with it. Have fun!
